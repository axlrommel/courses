# Definitions:
# A quarter is a specific three month period, Q1 is January through March, Q2 is April 
# through June, Q3 is July through September, Q4 is October through December.
# A recession is defined as starting with two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, 
# and ending with two consecutive quarters of GDP growth.
# A recession bottom is the quarter within a recession which had the lowest GDP.
# A university town is a city which has a high percentage of university students 
# compared to the total population of the city.
# Hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by 
# recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in 
# university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession 
# bottom. (price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom)
# The following data files are available for this assignment:
# From the Zillow research data site (http://www.zillow.com/research/data/) 
# there is housing data for the United States. 
# In particular the datafile for all homes at a city level, City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv, 
# has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.
# From the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of university towns in the 
# United States which has been copy and pasted into the file university_towns.txt.
# From Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the GDP 
# over time of the United States in current dollars (use the chained value in 2009 dollars), 
# in quarterly intervals, in the file gdplev.xls. For this assignment, 
# only look at GDP data from the first quarter of 2000 onward.

# Use this dictionary to map state names to two letter acronyms
