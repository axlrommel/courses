# Overview
#Tornadoes can be very deadly and destructive. In order to understand how strong tornadoes can get, scientists commonly use the Fujita scale, which rates tornadoes by damage caused. On one side of the Fujita scale are tornadoes of category EF0, which may damage trees but will not cause substantial damage to homes and buildings. On the other side of the scale, tornadoes of category EF5 are the strongest type of tornadoes, they are very damaging to structures and are often the most deadly. Most of the EF5 tornadoes occur in the Midwest and Southern United States. In this exercise we want to look at where exactly the strongest tornadoes occur, what months they are more likely to occur and how many deaths they are responsible for.
